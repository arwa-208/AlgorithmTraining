1. 

Pseudocode (often written as pseudo code) is an informal, human-readable way to describe an algorithm or program logic without using the strict syntax of any programming language.
Pseudocode explains what the program should do, not how to write it in a specific language.

2.
Why use pseudocode?
To plan program logic before coding
To understand algorithms easily
To communicate ideas between programmers and non-programmers
To avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic
When do we use pseudocode?

Before writing code

To plan the solution step-by-step
To avoid mistakes in logic

Example: planning an algorithm before coding in C#

When learning programming

Helps beginners understand how programs think
Easier than jumping directly into real code
To design algorithms
