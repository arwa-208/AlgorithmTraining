Pseudocode (often written as pseudo code) is an informal, human-readable way to describe an algorithm or program logic without using the strict syntax of any programming language.
Pseudocode explains what the program should do, not how to write it in a specific language.

2.
Why use pseudocode?
To plan program logic before coding
To understand algorithms easily
To communicate ideas between programmers and non-programmers
To avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic
When do we use pseudocode?

Before writing code

To plan the solution step-by-step
To avoid mistakes in logic

Example: planning an algorithm before coding in C#

When learning programming

Helps beginners understand how programs think
Easier than jumping directly into real code
To design algorithms

3.
To write pseudocode to represent an algorithm, first understand the problem and identify the inputs, processing steps, and outputs, then begin with START and end with END, write each step of the algorithm in logical order using simple, clear English, use common keywords such as INPUT, SET, IF–ELSE, WHILE or FOR for decisions and loops, keep the statements short and easy to read, and use indentation to show the structure so the algorithm’s flow is clear and can be easily translated into any programming language.

Problem: Find the largest of two numbers

START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
IF number1 > number2
    OUTPUT number1
ELSE
    OUTPUT number2
END
